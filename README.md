# Bank Notification System

> Microservice-based automated customer notification system for banking events (transactions, risk alerts, billing reminders) via SMS, Email and Push notifications.

## 📦 Overview

This project is a full-stack application developed as part of the **Web Application User Interface Development** course.  
It demonstrates a modern microservice architecture with **Spring Boot**, **React**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **Apache Kafka**, and **Docker**.

The system automatically sends personalised notifications to bank customers based on their preferences whenever a banking event occurs (e.g. a new transaction, a security alert, or a bill due date).  
Users can manage their notification preferences, view notification history, and administrators can manage message templates.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- JWT‑based authentication (access token)
- Role‑based access control (`USER` / `ADMIN`)
- Secure API Gateway that enforces authentication on all endpoints (except login/register)

### 📊 Dashboard
- Real‑time statistics: total notifications, pending, sent, failed

### ⚙️ Notification Preferences
- Set preferred channels per event type (SMS, Email, Push)
- Configure quiet hours (do not disturb)
- Enable / disable notifications for each event type
- Redis caching for fast reads with database fallback

### 📬 Notification History
- Paginated list with filtering by event type, channel, status and date range
- Retry failed notifications (re‑queues them via Kafka)

### 📄 Template Management (admin only)
- Create, update, delete notification templates with variable placeholders (`{{variable}}`)
- Multiple languages / locales
- Redis Pub/Sub cache synchronisation

### 🚀 Asynchronous Event Processing
- Apache Kafka topics: `bank.events`, `notification.send.command`, `notification.status`
- Event‑driven generation of notifications
- Idempotency via Redis SETNX (duplicate events are ignored)
- Simulated multi‑channel sending (SMS, Email, Push) with circuit breaker (Resilience4j)

### 🌐 Multi‑language UI
- Supports English, Russian and Chinese (react‑intl + Ant Design ConfigProvider)

## 🧱 System Architecture
The system consists of 6 microservices, 1 React frontend, and 3 middleware components, all orchestrated via Docker Compose.

Services and responsibilities:

Service	Port	Description
api-gateway	8080	Unified entry point, JWT authentication, route forwarding
customer-service	8081	User registration/login, notification preferences management
notification-service	8082	Consumes banking events, matches preferences, renders templates, generates and retries notifications
template-service	8083	Notification template CRUD, Redis cache synchronization
channel-service	8084	Channel sending (SMS/Email/Push) with circuit breaker and fallback
event-adapter	8085	Receives external events and publishes them to Kafka
frontend (React)	3000	Management interface (dashboard, preferences, history, templates)
Middleware: PostgreSQL 16, Redis 7, Apache Kafka (Zookeeper)

Typical request flow:

User logs in via api-gateway and obtains a JWT

Core banking system pushes an event to Kafka topic bank.events

notification-service consumes the event → fetches preferences → renders template → creates notification → sends command to Kafka topic notification.send.command

channel-service consumes the command → invokes the specific sending channel → writes result to Kafka topic notification.status

Frontend queries notification history, preferences, and statistics through the gateway

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker Compose)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) 4.x+
- Ports `3000`, `5432`, `6379`, `8080‑8085`, `9092` available

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youruser/bank-notification-system.git
   cd bank-notification-system
Start all services

bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
(First build may take a few minutes)

Access the application

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Default admin account: admin@bank.com / 123456

Stop the system

bash
docker compose down
📀 Test Data (optional)
To populate the database with 2,000 sample notifications, run:

bash
docker exec -i bank-postgres psql -U postgres -d bank_notifications < seed-data.sql
(Included in the repository root)

🧪 API Testing
A ready‑to‑use Apifox/Postman collection is available in the file api-tests.json at the root of the project.
Import it and run the following flow:

POST /api/auth/login – obtains JWT

GET /api/preferences – view current preferences

PUT /api/preferences – update preferences

GET /api/notifications/stats – dashboard statistics

GET /api/notifications?page=0&size=10 – notification history

POST /api/notifications/{id}/retry – retry a failed notification

POST /api/templates – (admin) create template

POST /api/events – send a test banking event
